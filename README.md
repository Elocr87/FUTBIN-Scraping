# FUTBIN-Scraping

The purpose of this project is getting FIFA UT data from the site https://www.futbin.com/ for its analysis.

In case you want to retrieve information from previous years, just need to change the number on the URL. However, there could be diferences from the code or columns. For example:
- For the Fifa 19: https://www.futbin.com/19/players?page=n (where n is the page number)
- For the Fifa 20: https://www.futbin.com/20/players?page=n (where n is the page number)
- For the Fifa 21: https://www.futbin.com/21/players?page=n (where n is the page number)
